# Fox Friday Twitter Bot
This is a Twitter bot that posts a picture of a fox every friday. It is built in Python using the Tweepy library.

# Motivation
I wanted to learn more Python and building a Twitter bot seemed like a simple project to complete. I'm also interested in learning how to more efficiently interact with APIs. 

# Build Status
All basic functionality has been added. In the future, I plan to add the following features:
- Tweet relevant hashtags with each image
- Tweet fox facts in addition to the images
- Update banner and icon for a more professional look
- Add functionality to follow users back
- Currently running as a weekly cronjob, move to hosting away from my local machine
